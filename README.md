# MicroJava Compiler
Object-oriented compiler implementation for MicroJava programming language. MicroJava is a simple language with Java-like syntax with support for basic object-oriented concepts. Compiler runs with only a single source code file, therefore all classes are defined as *inner-classes* as the *top-level class* is the program itself.

Made for the entry-level course in Compiler Construction at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering. (http://ir4pp1.etf.rs/)
